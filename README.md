# Carbon_Emissions_Prediction
## Problem Statement

Analysis of country-specific data and development of machine learning models in order to predict CO2 emissions from country parameters. The project uses the publicly available dataset Climate Change Data from the World Bank Group, which provides data on the vast majority of countries over a range of years for parameters such as:

* country: the vast majority of countries worldwide
* year: ranging from 1990 to 2011
* various emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2, CH4, N2O, others
* population-specific parameters: population count, urban population, population growth, etc.
* country economic indicators: GDP, GNI, Foreign Direct Investment, etc.
* land-related parameters: cereal yield, agricultural land, Nationally terrestrial protected areas, etc.
* climate data: precipitations, national disasters, etc.
* energy use
* counts of certain types of medical personnel
* etc.
